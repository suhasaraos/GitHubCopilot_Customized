# 🚀 OctoCAT Supply: The Ultimate GitHub Copilot Demo v1.13.0

![OctoCAT Supply](./frontend/public/hero.png)

Welcome to the OctoCAT Supply Website - your go-to demo for showcasing the incredible capabilities of GitHub Copilot, GHAS, and the power of AI-assisted development!

## ✨ What Makes This Demo Special

This isn't just another demo app - it's a carefully crafted showcase that demonstrates the full spectrum of GitHub's AI capabilities:

- 🤖 **Copilot Agent Mode & Vision** - Watch Copilot understand UI designs and implement complex features across multiple files
- 🎭 **MCP Server Integration** - Demonstrate extended capabilities with Playwright for testing and GitHub API integration
- 🧪 **Test Generation** - Exhibit Copilot's ability to analyze coverage and generate meaningful tests
- 🔄 **CI/CD & IaC** - Generate deployment workflows and infrastructure code with natural language
- 🎯 **Custom Instructions** - Show how Copilot can be tailored to understand internal frameworks and standards
- 📜 **Custom Prompt Files** - Automate repetitive tasks and documentation updates with ease

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application is built using modern TypeScript with a clean separation of concerns:

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, OpenAPI/Swagger
- **DevOps**: Docker

## 🎯 Hands-On Scenarios

## TENTANTIVE AGENDA - SUBJECT TO CHANGE - REPO WILL BE MOVED TO NEW ORG ONCE COMPLETED ##

1. **GUIDED HANDS-ON: Create Custom Instructions and a Custom Prompt File**
   This activity will be performed together as a group.
   - Use GitHub Copilot Ask Mode to ask Copilot about the API of the project or any other question about your repo. Use the `@workspace` command to give GitHub Copilot Context. 
      - Sample Prompt: `@workspace Please give me details about the API of this project.`
      - Sample Prompt: `Are there any core features missing in my project?`
   - Use GitHub Copilot Internal Prompting to update the custom instructions for the OctoCAT Supply project.
      - Use the `Gear` icon in the GitHub Copilot Chat window to select the `Generate Instructions` internal prompt. 
         - Create a generic (project wide) GitHub Copilot Instructions file.
            - Hint: This file should be in the base directory of the `.github` folder and have the name `copilot-instructions.md`.
         - Create an API specific GitHub Copilot Instructions file using the same process as before.
            - Hint: This file should be in the `.github/instructions` direcotry and have a name that resembles `API.instructions.md`
   - Ask GitHub Copilot questions about your project and discover the use of the `Custom Instructions` files that have been created. 
      - How does your response compare to before?
   - Review Existing GitHub Copilot Prompt files to learn about how they can help speed up your workflow.  Execute one if you'd like.
   - Use GitHub Copilot Internal Prompting to create a custom prompt file for the OctoCAT Supply project to update all existing documentation for the project.
         - Hint: Use the "Prompt Files" prompt to create a custom prompt file for the OctoCAT Supply project.  
      - Execute the custom prompt file to update all existing documentation for the project.
         - Hint: Use the slash command to execute the prompt all existing documentation for the project.  Specify the README.md file and the docs/architecture.md file if you only want that updated. 

2. **GUIDED HANDS-ON: Create a Chat Mode**
   This activity will be performed together as a group.
   - Have Copilot Create a Custom Chat Mode using **Agent Mode**
      - Use the `Gear` icon in the GitHub Copilot Chat window to select the `Modes` internal prompt.
         Hint: Sample Chat Mode:
            ```
            ---
tools: ['search', 'githubRepo', 'todos', 'github/create_pull_request_with_copilot']
description: Explore implementation ideas
model: Claude Sonnet 4
---

Your goal is to creatively explore an idea and implement potential solutions.

FIRST deeply research (using search tools, run in parallel as much as possible) the problem and solution space for the given idea.

THEN implement the solutions in this codebase in collaboration with coding agent. For each variation, call GitHub's `create_pull_request_with_copilot`. Focus on handing over the implementation details, Copilot coding agent will handle the step by step implementation. Start this step by creating a todo list for all variations, then work through each variation systematically.

Pause.

### NEW BRANCH NEEDED FOR THOSE THAT WANT A FRESH START -- WILL FINALIZE ONCE THE CONCEPT IS APPROVED ###
2. **Requirements Specifications and Agentic Implementation**
   - Use previously developed `custom chat mode` to define features and create an implementation plan
      - Use the "Plan" prompt combined with the MonaFigurine.png file (found in ./docs/design) to create an implementation plan for a new product offering on the website.
   - Generate UI components from design mockups (using Copilot Vision) and Generated Implementation Plan.
      - Reference the Implementation Plan created in the previous step to build out the new product offering on the website.
      - Use the MonaFigurine.png file to generate a product card component for the new product offering.
      - Integrate the new components into the existing React application.
   - Finalize the checkout Page using Copilot Vision
      - Use the CheckoutPage.png file to generate a checkout page for the new product offering.
      - Integrate the checkout page into the existing React application.



4. **Test Generation and Coverage Improvement**
   - Analyze existing test coverage
   - Generate unit and integration tests with Copilot
      - Hint: Use the "unit test coverage" prompt to generate unit tests for the Product and Supplier routes.
   - Improve coverage based on analysis
   - BONUS: Ask GitHub Copilot to execute the tests using the Playwright MCP server.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Build the projects:
   ```bash
   # Build API and Frontend
   npm install && npm run build
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Or use the VS Code tasks:
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` -> `Run Task` -> `Build All`
- Use the Debug panel to run `Start API & Frontend`

## 🛠️ MCP Server Setup (Optional)

Use VS Code command palette:
   - `MCP: List servers` -> `playwright` -> `Start server`
